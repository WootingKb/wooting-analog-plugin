# Wooting Analog SDK Plugin

This is Wooting's plugin for the [Analog SDK](https://github.com/simon-wh/Analog-SDK) providing easily extensible support for the Wooting One and Wooting Two.

NOTE: At the moment you need an beta firmware for the Wooting One and Wooting Two which hasn't been pushed to Wootility for this to work.
